# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

```Solid 4.5 out of 5```

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

``` 5/5```

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)


```I'm curious how to save a really good method I make into my terminal local account so I have access to it at all times without having to copy and paste it from somewhere```
